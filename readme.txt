Nighthawk PHP Site Tool

version 1.0

by Xtfer	chris@xtfer.com

Nighthawk is a lightweight tool for building small PHP sites using flat file
structures. It should work on any server which can run PHP and has a very low 
memory footprint. It assumes that all content is held in flat PHP files (not a
database), but makes it a little easier to join this content together.

Features:
	- Clean URLs
	- Generate clean links (using the k() function)
	- Relatively secure
	- Respects folder structures
	- Work mostly in HTML, and use PHP only when required.
	- Easy to learn

The basic Nighthawk setup includes some starter files and includes a version of
Eric Meyer's CSS reset by Steve Zeidner (http://stevezeidner.com/html-and-css-starter-templates).
You can replace the HTML & CSS as you wish, this has just been provided by way
of example.
